Current: A green ball and cube,  pink platform,  use inner triggers to lift objects when pointers are white

Blocker: Hand animation logic on left hand looks correct when checking booleans for transitions,
but not working.  Investigatng.

Next Path/s:

1. Adding a bounce to the ball, and adding rings for a simple 'hoop game'
2. Finish a project for XRTerra to make a 'car showroom'
3. Add Unit Tests for interactions and scoring on 'hoop game'
