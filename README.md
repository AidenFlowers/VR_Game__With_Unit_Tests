# VR Game With Unit Tests


VR Foundation World - Unit Test Practice

09/25/2022 - 

Current: A green ball and cube,  pink platform,  use inner triggers to lift objects when pointers are white.  
Play and Edit empty files set up,  filling in optimistically when add script layers below.  

Test Type/Platform:  Tested out with Oculus Quest 2 using Headset Cord Link to PC.  Works.

Blocker: Hand animation logic on left hand looks correct when checking booleans for transitions,
but not working.  Investigatng.

Next Path/s:

1. Adding a bounce to the ball, and adding rings for a simple 'hoop game'
2. Finish a project for XRTerra to make a 'car showroom'
3. Add Unit Tests for interactions and scoring on 'hoop game'
